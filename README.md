I developed a responsive trivia game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that tests players' knowledge across various categories. The game features a clean interface, multiple-choice questions with a countdown timer, a scoring system, answer feedback, and a final results screen. Players navigate through 10 questions, earning points for correct answers. JavaScript handles the game logic, randomly selecting questions, tracking scores, updating the display, and managing answer selections. The mobile-first design ensures the game looks great on any device. Extensive testing ensures the game runs smoothly and is optimized for performance. This project allowed me to practice JavaScript skills and create an engaging, interactive experience.
